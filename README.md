# Vault Ethereum Plugin v0.3.0

The first incarnation of the `vault-ethereum` plugin was an exercise in [experimenting with an idea](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/vault-platform-enterprise-blockchain) and [proving a point](https://immutability.io/). 2 years later, I feel both ends were acheived.

Having had several occasions to take this PoC to production with companies in the financial and blockchain communities [(plug for Immutability, LLC's custom development!)](mailto:jeff@immutability.io) I've decided to release an upgrade that tries to make the development experience better. I've also restricted the surface area of the plugin to a minimum.

Excepting the `convert` API, which I keep for entertainment value.

## Dependencies

Install the following: 

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

[jq](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq) or `brew install jq`

## Testing - in one terminal...

```sh

$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/immutability-io/vault-ethereum
$ make docker-build
$ make run

```

Then, **open a different terminal**...

```sh

$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/immutability-io/vault-ethereum/docker

# Authenticate
$ source ./local-test.sh auth
$ ./demo.sh > README.md

```

## View the demo

If everything worked... And you have run the command above, your demo is had by viewing the results: 

```sh
$ cat ./README.md
```

If everything didn't work, tell me why.

## What is the API?

The best way to understand the API is to use the `path-help` command. For example:

```sh
$ vault path-help vault-ethereum/accounts/bob/deploy                                                                [±new-version ●]
Request:        accounts/bob/deploy
Matching Route: ^accounts/(?P<name>\w(([\w-.]+)?\w)?)/deploy$

Deploy a smart contract from an account.

## Tip

Supporting OSS is very hard.
